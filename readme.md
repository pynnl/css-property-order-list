# CSS property order list

Properties are ordered by:

- Category
- Shorthand and longhand properties
- Top-right-bottom-left
- Width-height
- Alphabetically

Longhand properties are indented under their shorthand property to add visual semantics.

Prefixed, non-spec, and deprecated properties have been removed. Use [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer) to provide prefixed properties and values. Avoid using non-spec properties entirely.

Comments are not valid in json, and should be stripped before using. The .json file is [CSScomb](http://csscomb.com/) compatible.
